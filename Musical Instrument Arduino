Process:

At first we thought we would invent an instrument that only works when we shake, we would fill it half way up with water and once the wire touches the
water it would light up and make a sound. We attempted to realize this concept by placing two wires on the top portion of the bottle, which would break
the current when the bottle was upright. However, this did not work properly since the current was extremely unsteady, and the bottle began to leak
through the wire's perforations. Our last concept was to make a xylophone, but because we didn't want to utilize force sensors or buttons for every note,
we chose to use an ultrasonic sensor instead.

We were a little perplexed about how to begin with the ultrasonic sensor, so we looked it out on the internet and worked out how to link the sensor to
the code. We used the tone() method to write "if statements" for each key once we established the distances for our sensor. We also utilized an array to
hold all of our tones, making the if statements easier to write. We added a switch to attempt to meet the digital sensor requirement which worked greatly.
We then added a switch in a series circuit after asking for assistance, making it a manual switch.

We then tidied up our code and customized our instrument in this last step adding tape paddle to go with it. The plan was for the paddle to be at a certain 
distance where it would perform a different tone every time you hit in further.


final code:

const int pingPin = 7; // Trigger Pin of Ultrasonic Sensor
const int echoPin = 6; // Echo Pin of Ultrasonic Sensor

//tones

int speakerPin = 12;

int tones[] = {261, 277, 294, 311, 330, 349, 370, 392, 415, 440};
//            mid C  C#   D    D#   E    F    F#   G    G#   A

void setup() {
   Serial.begin(9600); // Starting Serial Terminal
}

void loop() {
   long duration, inches, cm;
   pinMode(pingPin, OUTPUT);
   digitalWrite(pingPin, LOW);
   delayMicroseconds(2);
   digitalWrite(pingPin, HIGH);
   delayMicroseconds(10);
   digitalWrite(pingPin, LOW);
   pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);
   duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
   inches = microsecondsToInches(duration);
   cm = microsecondsToCentimeters(duration);
   Serial.print(inches);
   Serial.print("in, ");
   Serial.print(cm);
   Serial.print("cm");
   Serial.println();
   delay(100);

 
   if (cm >= 2 && cm <= 5){
   tone(speakerPin, tones[1]);
   }
  
     else if (cm >5 && cm <= 8){
   tone(speakerPin, tones[2]);
   }

     else if (cm > 8 && cm <= 11){
   tone(speakerPin, tones[3]);
   }
  
    else  if (cm > 11 && cm <= 14){
   tone(speakerPin, tones[4]);
   }
    else  if (cm > 14 && cm <= 17){
   tone(speakerPin, tones[5]);
   }
    else  if (cm > 20 && cm <= 23){
   tone(speakerPin, tones[6]);
   }
    else  if (cm > 23 && cm <= 26){
   tone(speakerPin, tones[7]);
   }
    else  if (cm > 29 && cm <= 32){
   tone(speakerPin, tones[8]);
   }
    else  if (cm > 32 && cm <= 35){
   tone(speakerPin, tones[9]);
   }
   else  if (cm > 35 && cm <= 38){
   tone(speakerPin, tones[10]);
   }
   else {
    noTone(speakerPin);
   }
  
}

long microsecondsToInches(long microseconds) {
   return microseconds / 74 / 2;
}

long microsecondsToCentimeters(long microseconds) {
   return microseconds / 29 / 2;
}




reflection:

It was a difficult time to make the project since we both had different time schedules, she would be busy at night while im busy in the day. However,
we decided it would be best if we stayed up atleast one night to finally attempt to finish it. It turned amazing, my favourite bit of the whole project
it decorating the xylophone as well as the part where i left my whole stuff in the lab and not being able to access it until the next morning. The most
important part is that we finally got it done with.
