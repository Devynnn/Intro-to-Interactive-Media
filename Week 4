For this assignment, I've learned to implement google trend data onto P5.js. There was not much thought put into it as we learned it step by step in class.
I was looking for a serious topic that sparked a lot of peoples interest on the internet today and decided to go with Kanye West. Hilarious i know, but as you can
see through the data, at this moment the amount of timeS Kanye West has been searched for has peaked its highest. Its a whole process to go search and download
the information, but it gave me insight on how to add informational data to p5.js. I struggled with adding the ellipses instead of the vertex but I asked my classmates
for a little help, and they showed me their way. I also wanted to add some text that relates to Kanye, so i chose random colors with a dark background to show
how chaotic Kanye could be.



let string ="i want kim back";
let kanyeWestData;
function preload() {
  kanyeWestData = loadTable("multiTimeline.csv", "csv");
}

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  print(kanyeWestData.getRowCount());
  print(kanyeWestData.getColumnCount());
}

function draw() {
  background(0);
  noFill()
  beginShape();
  for (let i = 3; i < kanyeWestData.getRowCount(); i++) {
    print(kanyeWestData.getString(i, 0), kanyeWestData.getString(i, 1));
    let newYpos = map(kanyeWestData.getString(i, 1), 0, 100, height, 0);
    // vertex(i,newYpos);
stroke(random (0,255),random(0,255), random(0,255));
    ellipse(i, height - kanyeWestData.getString(i, 1), 80);
  }
  // endShape();

  for(let i =0;i<string.length;i++) {
    let xpos = 100+20*i;
    textSize(30);
    text(string[i], xpos, height/2+10*noise(frameCount/100+20*i));
}
}
