For this assignment, I've learned to implement google trend data onto P5.js. There was not much thought put into it as we learned it step by step in class.
I was looking for a serious topic that sparked a lot of peoples interest on the internet today and decided to go with Kanye West. Hilarious i know, but as you can
see throught the data, at this moment time the amount of time Kanye West has been searched for has peaked its highest. Its a whole process to go search and download
the information, but it gave me insight on how to add informational data to p5.js.

let kanyeWestData
function preload() {
  kanyeWestData=loadTable('multiTimeline.csv',"csv");
}

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  print(kanyeWestData.getRowCount());
  print(kanyeWestData.getColumnCount());
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  noFill();
  beginShape();
  for(let i=3;i<kanyeWestData.getRowCount();i++)
{
//print(kanyeWestData.getString(i,0),kanyeWestData.getString(i,1));
  let newYpos= map(kanyeWestData.getString(i,1),0,100,height,0);
  vertex(i,newYpos);
  
  //vertex(i,height-kanyeWestData.getString(i,1));
}
  endShape();
}
