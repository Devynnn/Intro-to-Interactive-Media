For this assignment, I've learned to implement google trend data onto P5.js. There was not much thought put into it as we learned it step by step in class.
I was looking for a serious topic that sparked a lot of peoples interest on the internet today and decided to go with Kanye West. Hilarious i know, but as you can
see throught the data, at this moment time the amount of time Kanye West has been searched for has peaked its highest. Its a whole process to go search and download
the information, but it gave me insight on how to add informational data to p5.js.
